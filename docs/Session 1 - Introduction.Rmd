## How to use an R Markdown file

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

## RStudio breakdown

RStudio shows you four panes:

1. The 'Source' pane: the file where you write your code
2. The 'Console' where actual code is run
3. The 'Environment' pane, which shows you variables / datasets
3. The 'Viewer' pane, which shows you plots and help files

You can arrange these in any order using Tools > Global Options.

## Setting the 'working directory'

At the very beginning of an R session you MUST set a 'working directory'. This tells R where to look for and save files. To do this type

```setwd("path/to/directory")```

Unfortunately, if you are on a windows machine you will need to change all backslashes ```\``` to forward slashes ```/```. This is because R follows UNIX conventions which are native to Linux and Mac computers.

If you are not sure what your working directory is type

```getwd()```

## Using R as a calculator

We can use the console for general arithmetic

```{r}
1 + 3 + 5

(2 + 9) / 7
```

We can also create variables, e.g.

```{r}
x <- 10

y <- 21

x*y

```

##Comments

If you'd like to comment on any code you write (i.e. you do not wish R to try to 'run' this code) just add a hash (```#```) or series of hashes in front of it, e
g

```{r}

df <- read.csv("csv_file.csv") # This reads in the main file for the experiment

```

##Functions

Most work in R is done using _Functions_. These take the following form: _function(argument(s))_. Here are some mathematical functions

```{r}

sqrt(10)

```

Have a look at the following argument called ```gsub```. What does it do? If you're not sure how to use the function, type ```?``` and the name of the function in the console, e.g. ```?gsub```.

```{r}

gsub("R-studio", "Rstudio", "R-studio is a greate piece of software")

grepl("chocolate", "Mary likes chocolate cookies")

```

##Objects

A variable is a type of 'object' which R stores in memory. R is capable of creating and storing a wide range of objects. To see what type of object we have created, we use the function ```class()```, e.g.

```{r}

class(x)

z <- "hello"

class(z)

```

*class* is one of the most useful functions in R as errors are often due to misassignment of class, e.g.

```{r, error = TRUE}

x + z

```

Here we have tried to add a number to a string which is clearly impossible. It's possible to change the class of an object using commands such as ```as.character```, ```as.integer```, ```as.numeric```, ```as.factor```, e.g.

```{r, error = TRUE}
one <- "1"

x + one

one <- as.numeric(one)

x + one
```

Here is a list of the main objects in R:

1. Numeric - a number with decimal places
2. Integer - a number without decimal places
3. Character - a string of letters/numbers
4. Vector - an ordered list of numbers or characters
5. Dataframe - a 2 x 2 array in which each column has a name

In order to create a vector we need to use the ```c``` function. (c = 'combine'), e.g.

```{r}
list.of.numbers <- c(1,4,54,22,43,9,0,0,21)

mean(list.of.numbers)

sd(list.of.numbers)
```

## Packages

To enhance the basic capabilities of R, we need to load packages. Most of the time, we download these from 'CRAN' ```Tools > Install packages```. Once the package is installed, we then need to _load_ it using the ```library()``` function. One of the most useful packages is called 'tidyverse'.

![](tidyverse.png)

It contains a number of useful commands for plots, and data manipulation. Install the 'tidyverse' package, and then load it with the following function:

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

```

## Working with indices

Whenever you wish to access the contents of an object with multiple values you use indexes. These are placed inside square brackets. Have a look at the following example:

```{r}

list.of.movies <- c("independence day", "pretty woman", "the godfather part two", "planet of the apes")

# The function c is used to create a list, or "vector"

list.of.movies[2]

```

Now let's make a dataframe from scratch

```{r}


rotten.tomatoes.variable <- c(62, 61, 97, 89)

df <- as.data.frame(cbind(list.of.movies, rotten.tomatoes.variable)) # 'cbind' binds columns together

```


## Working with dataframes

Now let's do some work with dataframes.

R has a native function to read .csv files: ```read.csv```. To read a .csv file type: ```df <- read.csv("name_of_file.csv")```. The .csv format is an excellent format for storing data as it is readable in Excel, smll, simple, and not easily-corrupted.

To read files in other format use the following packages:

1. .sav files (SPSS) and .dta files (STATA): ```foreign```
2. Excel files (.xls, .xlsx, xlsm): ```read_r``` (part of the tidyverse) or ```openxlsx```
