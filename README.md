# Welcome to the Adventures In R Workshop!

*This repository will serve as the base for designing and sharing materials for the 2018 Workshop in R.*

This workshop has been funded by the Faculty of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences, and is open to all postgraduate students at Newcastle University and universities which constitute the NINE-DTP consortium. The aim is to provide a strong foundation in what is fast becoming the standard package for data analysis, manipulation and visualisation. By the end of this course, attendees will have a sufficiently strong foundation to enable them to work on more complex challenges in their own time.

## Information:

**When:** 7-8 June; 09.00 -- 17.00  
**Where:** ARMB.G.17  
**Instructors:** Lauren Ackerman, Jalal Al-Tamimi, Danielle Turton, and Nick Riches  

Before the workshop, please make sure you have downloaded R and RStudio. [**This** brief tutorial](docs/Setting_Up.nb.html) may help.

## Schedule:

We anticipate that basic refreshments, including lunch, will be provided.

### Day 1:

**Morning:** Introduction to R and RStudio  
**Afternoon:** Visualisation and data manipulation  

### Day 2:

**Morning:** Processing text and corpus data  
**Afternoon:** Techniques for analysing data  

*We regret that due to the limited capacity of the room we may not be able to offer a place to all those who apply.*

## What to bring:

The room does not contain any PCs and we would ask attendees to *bring laptops with copies of R and RStudio already installed*
(please visit  https://www.r-project.org/ to download R, and https://www.rstudio.com/ to download RStudio). We believe that itâ€™s preferable to work on laptops rather than university machines as it is much easier to update R to the latest version.

### Notes:

16 May 2018: R version 3.5.0 has a known bug in its interface with RStudio version 1.1.447. This bug only seems to effect a small number of aspects of compiling R Notebooks (a tool that will be used throughout the workshop). We do not anticipate this becoming an issue during the workshop and will keep this page updated with any announcements regarding this bug. (It is currently being addressed by the RStudio development team as a high priority.)
